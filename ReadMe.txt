I tend to replicate the results of Li and Lin （2015）,
“Tax progressivity and tax incidence of the rich and the poor”.

Finally, I failed.

Here are some points worth to mention:
-I doubt the results of equation (7) in their paper.
-During calculation in Matlab, I choose the algorithm of Newton to solve the system
 of steady state equations. In fact, I cannot get their solutions because the matrix of
the system(i.e. equation 12-17 in their paper) is singular.

Here are some complaints:
-In their paper, the authors mentioned that "A detailed derivation is available on request."
 However, they didn't give me any feedback when I emailed both of them.
